My proposal titled “FedLessExit: Leveraging Early Exiting for Client Model Personalization in Serverless Federated Learning” got accepted at the <a href="https://softwarecampus.de/">Software Campus Program</a>. I will recieve a funding of 100,000 euros from BMBF and will work with Huawei Munich Research Center on the Project.
