I got selected as a speaker at the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/">Open Source Summit (OSS) Europe 2023</a> and will be speaking about  <a href="https://sched.co/1OGe2">serverless federated learning</a> and  <a href="https://sched.co/1OMeE">executing WebAssembly on HPC systems</a>.
