My name is Mohak Chadha. I am a third-year PhD student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) advised by <a href="https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/caps/mitarbeiter/michael-gerndt/">Prof. Dr. Michael Gerndt.</a> My research interests are in the domain of serverless, parallel, and high-performance computing.

During my PhD, I have spent time at the Processor Architecture Research group at Intel Labs. In addition, I am a participant of the <a href="https://softwarecampus.de/">Software Campus Program</a> (Class of 2022) in which I am collaborating with the Huawei Munich Research Center on the topic of Serverless Federated Learning.

<!-- where I worked on optimizing certain aspects of FaaS using the hardware features present on next-generation Intel processors. -->

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my masters in Computer Science from TUM in 2020. During my masters, I worked at the Central Research and Technology (CRT) department at Airbus in Munich on two EU funded projects, i.e., <a href="https://www.aramis2.org/">Aramis 2.</a> and <a href="https://www.coems.eu/">COEMS.</a>. 

Before my masters, I recieved my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Master's in Mathematics from  <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">Birla Institute of Technology and Science-Pilani</a> in India. During that time, I interned at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/">Nvidia</a>, <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/zih">Center for Information Services and High Performance Computing</a>, TU Dresden, and <a href="https://www.csircmc.res.in/ceeri">Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute</a>, Pilani.
